          <p>Prof. Zhang Yaoxue was born in Li County, Hunan province, China, in 1956. He graduated from Northwest Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, China, obtained his Ph.D degree in computer networking from Tohoku University, Japan in 1989. One year later, he joined Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, China.</p>
          <p>He was a visiting professor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and University of Aizu, in 1995 and 1998, respectively. From 1995 to 1997, he served in part time as the Deputy Director of Computer and Informatization Promotion Division of former Ministry of Electronics Industry and the Deputy Director of the office of National Promotion and application of electronic information systems.  From the end of 1998 to 1999, He served in part time as the General Manager of (IBM and Tsinghua University joint ventured) Beijing Dingxin Information System, Inc.  From July 1999 to 2001, he worked as the Deputy Director and Director of Science and Technology Division of Ministry of Education, China.  He served as the President of China Central Radio &amp; TV University from Nov. 2001 to Jun. 2006. He was the Director General for Higher Education of Ministry of Education, China from 2001 to July 2009. Currently, Prof. Zhang is a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, a member and the Deputy Secretary-General of Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council (ADCSC) and the Diretor of the Offcice of ADCSC, and a professor in computer science and technology in Tsinghua University. He is also a member of the Advisory Committee on State Informatization, and of Technical Committee on Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing of China Computer Federation. From July 2009 to January 2012, he served as deputy secretary general of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council,as well as the director of the office. He served as president of Central South University from November 2011 to June 2017. Additionally, he serves as an editorial board member of 4 international journals: International Journal of Wireless and Mobile Computing, Journal of Autonomic and Trusted Computing, Chinese Journal of Electronics and Chinese Journal of Computer.</p>
          <p>Prof. Zhang's major research areas include computer networking, operating systems, and ubiquitous/pervasive computing. He has led many national and international research, international collaboration and industrialization projects. Because of his distinguished contributions, Prof. Zhang has won the National Award for Scientific and Technological Progress (2nd class) twice in 1998 and 2001, and National Award for Technological Invention (2nd class) in 2004, as well as 5 provincial or ministerial awards. He is a winner of the Prize of HLHL (Hong Kong) Foundation for Scientific and Technological Progress in 2005. He has been granted 34 Chinese patents and 4 American patents. Accordingly, he won the Top Patent Award of China in 2006. Prof. Zhang has published over 180 technical papers in international journals and conferences, as well as 9 monographs and textbooks. He received the Best Paper Award in the 21st IEEE AINA international conference in 2007 and in the 16th IEEE HPCC international conference in 2014.</p>
          <p>Recently, Prof. Zhang's research mainly focuses on Transparent Computing and Active Services. <a target="_blank" href="./doc/transcom.pdf">Transparent Computing</a> is a computing paradigm to solve the problem of how to access different operating systems and applications on one terminal platform through networks, and how to run an operating system and applications on different terminal platforms.  <a target="_blank" href="./doc/active_services.pdf">Active Services</a> is a new approach to evolve current programs and services according to user requirements to provide personalized and comprehensive network services.</p>
